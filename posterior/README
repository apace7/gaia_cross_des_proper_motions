Columns:
Weight
satellite mean pmra
satellite mean pmdec
MW mean pmra
MW mean pmdec
MW dispersion pmra, log10 space/Jeffreys prior
MW dispersion pmdec, log10 space/Jeffreys prior
fraction MW

In order to properly derive statistics the weight column must be used.  
Note that most of early part of chain can be removed because the weight is so low.
